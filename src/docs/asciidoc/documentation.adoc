pass:[*] The SDK creates Ant-based projects that any Java IDE can import. We recommend users of other IDEs to also download the jMonkeyEngine SDK and choose `menu:File[Import Project > External Project Assets]` to create a codeless project for managing assets only. This way you can code in the IDE of your choice, and use the SDK to convert your models to .j3o format.


== Create

After downloading and installing, <<jme3#,bookmark the jME Documentation page>> and start writing your first game!
