== ATOMIX TUTORIALS


== FIRST WORDS

*Dear monkeys,*

Long time ago I planed to make tutorial series in making games in JME3 and done some examples. I waited for our project to reach a stable status. May be now is the best time to show them up!
A lot of changes have been make to the core and also a lot of excited and amazing contributions into the world of JME this day (you can name some).

OK, my project had changed to Atomix Tutorial Series (short as ATS).

I decided not to do the voice since it will make you guys too difficult to flow cause I’m not a native speaker. So i will write the tutorials down step by step and also do slideshows and videos for them. Typos correction are always welcome ! emoji:

If you are very new to Java, it's not recommend for you to take these tutorials at first. +

They require quite advanced techniques, suited for advanced Java developer which new to game programming, or one come from other engine. They are writen detailed and intended like to squeeze all the juice out of the things.
