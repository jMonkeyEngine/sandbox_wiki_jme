jMonkeyEngine 3 有給 Virtual Reality (VR) 非常大的支援. 目前知道的支援系統是:

HTC Vive 以及 支援 SteamVR/OpenVR 的系統

Razer HDK 以及 支援 OSVR的系統

Google Cardboard / GoogleVR

舊有: Oculus Rift 0.5

In any form of VR, a library is needed as support is not built in to the core of jMonkeyEngine3.

== jMonkeyVR (https://github.com/phr00t/jMonkeyVR)
This is the main library to use when you want wide VR support. It has full OpenVR/SteamVR support and OSVR support in the making (as of Oct 2016)

== jme3-osvr (https://github.com/neph1/jme3-osvr)
Together with https://github.com/neph1/OSVR-Java provides rudimentary OSVR support (extended mode). Examples: https://github.com/neph1/jme3-osvr-examples

== gvr-android-jme (https://github.com/nordfalk/gvr-android-jme)
Google Cardboard VR SDK 1.0 integration

== Legacy
There is legacy support for Oculus Rift up to version 0.5: https://github.com/neph1/jmonkeyengine-oculus-rift
