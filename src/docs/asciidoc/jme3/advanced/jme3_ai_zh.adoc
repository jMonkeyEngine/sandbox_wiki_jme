Most games written need some type of link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence_(video_games)[Artificial Intelligence] to deliver a feeling of realism, excitement or challenge to the player. AI can be as simple as having an NPC (Non Player Character) respond to some action taken by a player or as complicated as smoothly navigating your way through a scene full of obstacles without getting stuck. It's a time-consuming and significant challenge to develop these systems so its much easier to use an existing library to do the heavy lifting for you. 

Unfortunately, the jMonkeyEngine comes with no official library for dealing with AI. There is, however, the jme3 Artificial Intelligence library that is probably the closest there is to an official release. Although it never made it into any official releases, it was designed, in part, by core team members. It consists of two separate AI models, a link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navigation_mesh[Navigation Mesh] library using link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathfinding[path-finding], and a simple Steering Behaviours library that uses path-following.

You can read about the introduction of the library in the forum thread: link:https://hub.jmonkeyengine.org/t/ai-plugin-now-with-navmesh-pathfinding/24644[AI plugin now with NavMesh pathfinding].

== 要求

*  link:https://github.com/MeFisto94/jme3-artificial-intelligence/releases[jme3 Artificial Intelligence Library] - The library and javaDocs for jme3AI. This is also where you can report problems or help in maintaining the library.
*  link:https://github.com/stevefsp/critterai/releases[CritterAI] - Stephen Pratts' link:http://www.critterai.org/projects/nmgen_study/[NMGen Study] project files to generate the navmesh.
*  To get the assets (3D models) used in this example, add the <<sdk/sample_code#jme3testdata-assets#,jME3-testdata.jar>> to your classpath.
*  Java SDK 8+.

Stephen Pratt explains in detail the configuration parameters of CritterAI/Jme3AI in a easy to follow format and is suggested reading.

== 使用範例


The jme3 Artificial Intelligence Library contains:

*  NavMesh - A Navigation Mesh path-finding AI system using the link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm[A*] algorithm.footnote:[Path-finding means computing the shortest route between two points. Usually mazes.]
*  Steering - The foundations of an link:http://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-6-autonomous-agents/[Autonomous Agent] system that uses path-following and forces to move a character through its environment. Includes a test case as well.footnote:[Path-following is taking a path that already exists and then following that path.] 

[NOTE]
====
This scope of this tutorial is restricted to the NavMesh part of the library and expands upon the lessons taught in the <<jme3#tutorials-for-beginners,tutorials>>. It demonstrates the use of some classes and methods found in the Medium and Advanced topics of the wiki as well.

== Other AI Options

There are other jME3 specific options available you can read about in the wiki under the topic link:https://jmonkeyengine.github.io/wiki/jme3.html#artificial-intelligence-ai[Artificial Intelligence (AI)].
