This guide will show you how to effectively set up your Eclipse environment for not only a basic JME3 project, but an Android project, an assets project, and a JNI project (including the ability to build for Android through NDK).

While you do not have to create a project of each type to use Eclipse and this guide, note that the Android and JNI projects do require having a base Eclipse project to be applicable using this guide.

The code samples provided in this guide should work for any IDE, but setting up/configuring your IDE to do what Eclipse does in this particular guide may require some creative workarounds.


[WARNING]
====
Please note that projects that use Android UI elements or are created using Eclipse *can not* be ported to iOS. See <<jme3/android#,this page>> on how to create a cross-platform project using the jME SDK *that can also be edited in the Eclipse IDE*. This saves you the setup work outlined below.
====



== 設定JME3

I will assume you already have downloaded (and built, if necessary) the JME3 binaries. If not, either download the link:http://hub.jmonkeyengine.org/downloads/[latest SDK release], link:http://updates.jmonkeyengine.org/stable/3.0/engine[engine build] (recommended for new users), or take a quick detour over to <<jme3/build_from_sources#,this guide>> to build from source (recommended for advanced users).


[NOTE]
====
One directory you should have on hand (or know where to find) is the location of the resulting library (JAR) files.
====


For the various methods of obtaining the libraries (as described above), the path is usually in one of the following places:

*  *SDK*: [SDK Install Dir]/jmonkeyplatform/libs
*  *Nightly*: /libs
*  *Source*: [SDK Dir]/sdk/build/cluster/libs


[TIP]
====
Throughout the course of this guide, *do not copy JAR files* to any project directory - leave them in their original spots so they can be easily updated for when a JME3 update comes out or when you rebuild the source.
====



== 工作空間

If you are unfamiliar with Eclipse and how it lays out/stores its configuration, one of the first things that you should be aware of is that almost all settings that are set at a workspace-level (i.e. through _Window → Preferences_) are stored in the workspace.

You can select your workspace either by starting Eclipse (if the initial prompt is enabled) or by navigating to _File → Switch Workspace → Other_.

image:jme3/eclipse-switch-workspace.png[Eclipse: Switch Workspace,width="",height=""]

For this guide, we're going to create a new folder called `JMonkey` in our `C:\` drive, however this folder can be anywhere on your drive (the same applies for users of other operating systems). We will also switch to it as a workspace.


== 基本 JME3 專案 (電腦)

*Prerequisites*:

*  JME3 (downloaded/extracted/built/installed) libraries 位置

It's time to create our base JME3 project, which is actually relatively easy. Go to _File → New → Java Project_.

NOTE: If you don't see _Java Project_, you are more than likely in a perspective other than Java or Java EE. Simply select _Project…_ and then select _Java → Java Project_ from the window that appears.

Give your project a name (we'll call ours `JMEclipse-Base`) and click _Finish_. The project should show up in the Project Explorer pane on the left.

First, we need to configure our build path. Right click the new project entry and go to _Build Path → Configure Build Path_, and then select the _Libraries_ tab.

There are a number of libraries you're going to need to include, as the 'core' JME3 system requires them.


[IMPORTANT]
====
There will be many libraries in the previously identified `libs` folder that aren't initially used. Certain aspects of JME3 (for instance, collision detection) will require the appropriate JAR if your code requires that functionality. However, it is highly recommended you do NOT include every JAR in the `libs` folder due to the fact that exporting them all when they are not needed will result in a huge jar file (~60MB).
====


Click _Add External JARs…_, navigate to the JME3 `libs` folder (see _Setting up JME3_ if you're not sure where this is), and select each of the following:

*  jME3-core.jar
*  jME3-desktop.jar
*  jME3-jogl.jar
*  jME3-lwjgl-natives.jar
*  jME3-lwjgl.jar
*  jogl-all.jar
*  lwjgl.jar
*  vecmath.jar

Add the JARs, hit _OK_, and you've successfully set up the base JME3 build path for your project.

The last bit that must be added are assets. 備註 that while the SDK has a single way of managing your assets, assets can be handled in a number of ways in other IDEs.

The rule for assets is that their files *must be on the build path*. This means that you can either include the inner folders directly in your project, or you can create a separate project (and thus, a separate JAR) for your assets.

Alternatively, you can keep them in the local directory if you do not wish to package them with the JAR, though this may not be desirable for certain deployments (such as applets, Android apps, or JNLPs).


[NOTE]
====
To include your assets within your base project, follow the _Assets_ section without creating a new project. However, do note that this will make the process of including these assets in your Android project, if you create one, much harder.
====


Finally, the SDK creates a base source file for you that ends up being the main JME3 entry point. Since we're using Eclipse, we'll have to manually create that file.

Right click your project, go to _New → Class_, and fill out the appropriate information:

*  *Package*: your package name (i.e. `com.jme3.test`)
*  *Name*: the class name (i.e. `MyGame`)
*  *Superclass*: `com.jme3.app.SimpleApplication`

Then hit Finish. This will create and open the new class file. Eclipse should have automatically inserted the method “simpleInitApp() for you. This is where all of your game's start up code will go.

Finally, create a `main` function as the Java entry point:

[source,java]
----

public static void main(String[] args) {
    MyGame app = new MyGame();
    app.start();
}

----


=== 執行中

Running your JME3 project is quite simple in Eclipse. You can either link:http://help.eclipse.org/juno/index.jsp?topic=/org.eclipse.jdt.doc.user/tasks/tasks-java-local-configuration.htm[create a Java run configuration] or you can simply hit `CTRL + F11` to run the project (if Eclipse doesn't know what to do, it will ask).


=== 包裝(Packaging)

Packaging your JME3 project is also very straightforward. Assuming you heeded the warning stated earlier about not including every JAR in the `libs` folder, you should be able to right click your base JME3 project, go to _Export…_, select _Java → Runnable JAR file_, specify an output location and click _Finish_.

If you have assets set up as a JAR, make sure to read the _Packaging_ section under _Assets_.


== 附件專案

Each JME project has a set of assets that are used to load textures, models, and other resources used by your game.

As mentioned earlier, assets can be located/included in one of several ways. This section will describe how to include your project's assets through the use of a separate JAR file, which has the added advantage of allowing you to update assets without needing to update the JAR itself. If you have a dynamic class-path system set up, this could be very useful.

First, create another *generic* project by going to _File → New → Project… → General → Project_ and giving it a name (we'll call ours `JMEclipse-Assets`).


[TIP]
====
We create a General (non-Java) project for cleanliness because our assets will not require any special build settings or the like.
====


For new users, it's a good idea to add the initial JME3 folders that the SDK creates, as they are referenced by many other guides on the web. To do this, for each of the following right click on the assets project and go to _New → Folder_, type in the name listed, and hit _Finish_:

*  介面
*  MatDefs
*  材質
*  模型
*  畫面
*  陰影
*  聲音
*  Textures

Although this specific structure is what the JMonkeyEngine SDK generates upon the creation of a new project, it is by no means the only way to structure your project. All asset loading methods will work with folder names other than those listed above.


=== Packaging

Packaging your assets is also a simple process. Right click the assets project and click _Export…_ and then select _Java → Jar file_. It will show a list of files you can export; make sure to uncheck all files such as `.classpath`, `.project`, and any `.jardesc` files you may have created. As well, ensure only the resources and assets you want to export are checked.

Check _Export generated class files and resources_, select a destination for the JAR file, and check _Compress the contents of the JAR file_, _Add directory entries_, and _Overwrite existing files without warning_. Click _Finish_.


[TIP]
====
Optionally, you can click _Next_ and specify a `.jardesc` file by checking _Save the description of this JAR in the workspace_ and specifying a location for a `.jardesc` file. That way you can simply double-click the `.jardesc` file and easily re-export your assets when they change (remember, always refresh your project before exporting!).

== Andoid專案

*Prerequisites*:

*  JME3 (downloaded/extracted/built/installed) libraries located
*  JME3 Base Project created (as described above)
*  Android SDK downloaded and the Android 8 (2.2) target installed (higher +++<abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr>+++ versions work too but may limit compatibility when deploying)
*  Assets compiled into a JAR (see _Packaging_ under _Assets_)
*  link:http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/installing-adt.html[Eclipse ADT plugin] installed

The Android project is a slightly more involved setup project, but is still quite simple, even for new users.

To start, create another Android project by going _File → New → Project… → Android → Android Application Project_.

Fill out the following information and then click Next:

*  *Application Name*: name of your application (i.e. `JMEclipse Test Project`)
*  *Project Name*: name of the project in the workspace (i.e. `JMEclipse-Android`)
*  *Package Name*: name of the base package, preferably the same as the one used in the base project (we'll re-use `com.jme3.test`)
*  *Minimum Required SDK*: +++<abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr>+++ 8 (Must be AT LEAST SDK 8 for OpenGLES2 and JNI)


[NOTE]
====
Most of the lower options are defaulted based off of your ADT configuration and should work as-is.
====


After clicking _Next_, uncheck _Create activity_ (JME3 provides a base activity class). You can check/uncheck _Create custom launcher icon_ at your own preference.

Make sure that _Mark this project as a library_ is unchecked and hit _Finish_ (or _Next_ if you chose to create a custom launcher icon; this will take you to a customization page, after which you will be forced to finish).

First, we need to set up our build path. Surprisingly enough, it's much easier than the base project, though it is done a little differently.

At the time of this guide's writing, the latest release of the ADT/Eclipse plugin creates a `libs` folder within your project structure. This special folder automatically includes all of its contents on the build path.

Normally, you would drop the JAR files directly into this folder. However, this is undesirable as future releases/builds of JME3 would require you to re-copy all of the JAR files. Instead, we will simply link them.

For each of the following, right click the `libs` folder within your Android project and go to _New → File_, click _Advanced »_, check _Link to file in the file system_, click _Browse…_, navigate to the JME3 `libs` folder (as identified in the _Setting up JME3_ section above), double click the listed JAR file, and then click _Finish_:

*  jME3-android.jar
*  jME3-core.jar


[IMPORTANT]
====
There will be many libraries in the previously identified `libs` folder that aren't initially used. Certain aspects of JME3 (for instance, collision detection) will require the appropriate JAR if your code requires that functionality. However, it is highly recommended you do NOT include every JAR in the `libs` folder due to the fact that exporting them all when they are not needed will result in a huge jar file (~60MB).
====


As well, repeat the above step for your compiled assets JAR (see _Packaging_ under _Assets_).

Now that the core JME3 libraries have been added, we'll need to include our base project's code. To do this, right click on the Android project and go to _Build Path → Configure Build Path_, select the _Projects_ tab, click _Add_, and select the base project (in our case, `JMEclipse-Base`).

Lastly, select the _Order and Export_ tab. Ensure that your base project (i.e. `JMEclipse-Base`), _Android Private Libraries_, _Android Dependencies_, and optionally _Google APIs_ (if you have that target enabled) are checked. This step is important, or your project's libraries/assets will NOT be exported into the end APK.

Click _OK_, and your project's build path will be set up.

The next step is to create the application's activity and edit `AndroidManifest.xml` to configure the project to actually use our JME3 project.

First, right click on the Android project and go to _New → Class_, entering the following information and hitting _Finish_:

*  *Package*: your application package (it's best to use the package specified in the project creation dialog; for this guide, we'll re-use `com.jme3.test`)
*  *Name*: the activity class' name (i.e. `JMEclipseActivity`)
*  *Superclass*: `com.jme3.app.AndroidHarness`

This will create a new activity class. In the resulting file, create a default constructor and add the following code:

[source,java]
----

public JMEclipseActivity()
{
	// Set the application class to run
	appClass = "com.jme3.test.MyGame";

	// Try ConfigType.FASTEST; or ConfigType.LEGACY if you have problems
	eglConfigType = ConfigType.BEST;

	// Exit Dialog title & message
	exitDialogTitle = "Quit game?";
	exitDialogMessage = "Do you really want to quit the game?";

	// Choose screen orientation
	screenOrientation = ActivityInfo.SCREEN_ORIENTATION_LANDSCAPE;

	// Invert the MouseEvents X (default = true)
	mouseEventsInvertX = true;

	// Invert the MouseEvents Y (default = true)
	mouseEventsInvertY = true;
}

----


[TIP]
====
Pay close attention to the values above; `appClass` MUST be the full package + class name of the class in your base project that extends `SimpleApplication` (for advanced users, this is actually a subclass of `com.jme3.app.Application`).
====



=== Running

Running your Android project is just like link:http://developer.android.com/tools/building/building-eclipse.html[running any other Android project]. Assuming you've set up your build path correctly as instructed above, your application should deploy to any device/emulator and run as expected.


=== Packaging / Deploying

Packaging your Android project is too vast to entirely cover in this guide. As this step is different for each project, I will simply link to this guide to link:http://developer.android.com/tools/publishing/app-signing.html[signing and exporting your APK] as it outlines the most common steps to exporting you Android application to be uploaded directly to Google Play (fmly. App Market).


== Native (JNI + NDK) Project

*Prerequisites*:

*  JME3 Base Project created (as described above)
*  link:http://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/ehchua/programming/howto/EclipseCpp_HowTo.html[Eclipse CDT plugin] installed
*  At least one configured toolchain for compiling on desktop platforms (Cygwin/MinGW/MSVC/GCC/etc.)
*  Familiarity with JNI and how native libraries are included in a Java application's architecture (this section will assume you do)
*  JDK 給 Java 6 或以上

*If additionally building for Android*:

*  Android SDK downloaded and the Android 8 (2.2) target installed (higher +++<abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr>+++ versions work too but may limit compatibility when deploying)
*  Android NDK 下載
*  Optional: link:http://tools.android.com/recent/usingthendkplugin[NDK Eclipse plugin] installed (although I haven't seen a real need for it quite yet - it's mainly for building/launching native Activities)


[WARNING]
====
It should be mentioned that this section will not go into C/C++ best practices, sample code, or any details about the inner workings of JNI; instead, this section simply shows you how to set up the environment/configurations to create a near-seamless build environment for including your native code in both your base project as well as your Android project (if you've created one).
====


編譯 JNI is actually quite straightforward (assuming you know how the C/C++ build process works). Even for Android, the NDK provides a slick system for building/including your compiled binaries in your project.

First, create a new C/C++ project by going to _File → New → Project… → C/C++ → C++ Project_ and clicking _Next_, giving it a name (we'll use `JMEclipse-Native`), expanding _Shared Library_ and selecting _Empty Project_, then selecting a toolchain (select the most appropriate for compiling on your immediate desktop/platform, even if you plan on compiling for Android). Click _Finish_.

Next, we need to configure our build settings. Right click the native project, click _Properties_ and go to _C/C++ Build → Settings_. Select the _Build Artifact_ tab, ensure the drop down menu says _Shared Library_, and change the _Artifact name_ field to what you want to call your eventual JNI module.


[WARNING]
====
What you call your artifact is VERY important to how Java loads your library. For instance, linux dynamic library (.SO) objects require that the library have the “lib prefix. Keep this in mind when specifying an artifact name.
====


If you plan on building for Android, you must include an Android makefile in your project. In order for the build process to be as seamless as possible, this guide sets it up unlike most tutorials instruct.

To do this, simply create a new file in your native project called `Android.mk` and link:http://www.kandroid.org/ndk/docs/ANDROID-MK.html[set it up accordingly].


[IMPORTANT]
====
Even though the native project is not the Android project's directory, keep the `LOCAL_PATH` variable set to `my-dir`. This is important!
====


Next, we need to create a configuration for the Android target.


[NOTE]
====
This step is only relevant/possible if you have the NDK Eclipse plugin installed. Otherwise, you will need to install awk/make (using Cygwin if on Windows) and build through the command line manually.
====


To do this, right click your native project, click _Properties_, and go to _C/C++ Build → Tool Chain Editor_. For the configuration, click _Manage Configurations…_ and create new configuration(s) based on the current default configurations, putting “Android in the name. Lastly, click _OK_.

For each of the Android configurations you just created, select them in the _Configuration_ drop down menu, set _Current toolchain_ to _Android GCC_, set _Current builder_ to _Android Builder_, then click _Select Tools…_, remove everything from the right side and replace the last item with _Android GCC Compiler_. Click _Apply_ and then _OK_.

After the toolchains have been set up, go to _C/C++ Build_ and select the _Builder Settings_ tab. For each of the Android configurations, select them in the _Configuration_ drop down menu and change the _Build directory_ to the Android project directory by clicking _Workspace…_ and selecting the Android project (in our case it'd be `JMEclipse-Android`).

The last step in the Android setup is to create a symlink called `jni` (case sensitive) inside your Android project root that points to the root of your native project:

*  *Windows*: CMD prompt → `cd path\to\Android\project` → `mklink /J jni path\to\native\project`
*  *Linux/Mac*: Terminal → `cd path/to/Android/project` → `ln -sv path/to/native/project jni`


[TIP]
====
What this has essentially done is created a separate project for C/C++ building while tricking the Android project into thinking the source files are located directly in the Android project itself. With this configuration scheme, you can easily build regular shared libraries for desktop platforms as well as build/install the Android libraries using the NDK without the need to have a copy of the source code inside of the `jni` folder of an Android project. By setting the workspace for the Android builder and creating a link, it executes the NDK builder inside your Android project while serving the source files as if they existed in the `jni` folder.
====


Lastly, some additional include paths need to be added. Within the properties window, go to _C/C++ General → Paths and Symbols_ and select the _Includes_ tab.

Under _Languages_, select _GNU C++_ (or the correct C++ equivalent) and then _Add…_. Specify the absolute path to your JDK's `include` folder, check _Add to all configurations_, and hit _OK_.


[TIP]
====
For Windows platforms, repeat the above step for the `win32` directory within the JDK's `include` folder.
====


After hitting _OK_, you are now set to write your JNI code.


=== Building

Building your native project is fairly straightforward.

First, right click the native project, go to _Build Configurations_, select the configuration you want to build, and then right click the native project again and select _Build Project_. Short of packaging, that's all there is to it.


=== Packaging / Deploying

Packaging and deploying your native libraries is a two-sided topic. For Android, the NDK build script installs these for you, and they are packaged directly into the APK. For desktop applications, however, there are a multitude of ways to package your libraries - all of which are too vast to be included in this guide.

These libraries, however, are simply JNI libraries and should be loaded as such. A simple web search will explain how JNI works and how to load these libraries.
