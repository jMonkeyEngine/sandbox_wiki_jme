We recommend downloading the link:https://github.com/jMonkeyEngine/sdk/releases/tag/stable[jMonkeyEngine SDK] - but of course you can also build the jMonkeyEngine yourself from the sources. In this case, you need the link:http://subversion.tigris.org[Subversion] file version system installed (svn).

.  *Checkout:* Checkout the Subversion repository.
+
[source]
----
svn checkout http://jmonkeyengine.googlecode.com/svn/branches/3.0final/engine jme3
----

**  You can leave login and password empty

.  *Build:* Execute `ant jar`
**  This compiles the JAR files in `dist/libs/*`

.  *Javadoc:* Execute `ant javadoc` 
**  This generates javadocs in the `dist/javadoc` directory.

.  *Run:* Execute `ant run`
**  This runs the TestChooser where you can browse examples.

.  *Use:* Create a Java SE project and place all JARs from the `dist/lib` directory on the classpath.
**  You can now extend your first game from `com.jme3.app.SimpleApplication`. 


For a detailed description of the created jar files see <<jme3/jme3_source_structure#structure_of_jmonkeyengine3_jars,this list>>.
